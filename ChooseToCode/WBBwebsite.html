    <h2 style="font-family:orig_nationalbook">Passport to Success</h2>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook">The World Bachelor in Business (WBB) partnership is a bold new direction in higher education. A cohort of 45 students from across the globe study at three highly regarded business schools, each in a major economic and cultural zone. At the end of
        four years, students have completed the coursework for all three universities, earning a bachelor’s degree from each institution.</p>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook">The WBB is the only undergraduate program of its kind, designed to engage intellectually curious and entrepreneurial students in a business curriculum that connects leading-edge teaching methods with cultural immersion and real-world experiences.
        Students become versed in the fundamentals of business in Asia, Europe and North America. With access to the resources of three research universities, students can expect rewarding opportunities for learning with internationally renowned teacher-scholars,
        as well as through research, activities and internships that give them access to companies and leaders making a global impact.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #DAA520;">Pursue a global itinerary. Multiply your assets.</h2>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook">This is an approach to education that global executives want, an approach that will prepare a new generation of leaders for the opportunities of an interconnected world. At the end of this journey, students are global citizens fluent in the language
        of international business and join alumni networks with nearly endless reach and influence.</p>
