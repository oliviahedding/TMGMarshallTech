        Students become versed in the fundamentals of business in Asia, Europe and North America. With access to the resources of three research universities, students can expect rewarding opportunities for learning with internationally renowned teacher-scholars,
        as well as through research, activities and internships that give them access to companies and leaders making a global impact.</p>

    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook">This is an approach to education that global executives want, an approach that will prepare a new generation of leaders for the opportunities of an interconnected world. At the end of this journey, students are global citizens fluent in the language
        of international business and join alumni networks with nearly endless reach and influence.</p>

    <h1 style="color:#DAA520 " style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">Career Services and Placement</h1>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">One reason for creating the WBB program was to respond to the demand expressed by the business world for young managers with international training. In order to help WBB students successfully launch their careers, each school will endeavor to identify
        specific internship opportunities. WBB students will have access to career counselors and career development resources and activities at all three schools, giving them extra tools to become the drivers of their professional lives, whatever path
        they choose after graduation. WBB graduates will be well positioned for careers in a broad range of areas in the private and public sectors, for their own entrepreneurial initiatives or for graduate school.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">Admissions</h1>
    <p>Applicants are evaluated on the content and rigor of their high school coursework, their grades, standardized test scores, activities summary, essay and counselor/teacher recommendations.</p>

    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">*For more information and instructions, please visit: https://app.kiratalent.com/applicant/bs0YqQ/instructions. At the discretion of the admission committee, personal interviews may be required for admission consideration. Other supplementary materials
        and information may also be required. It is incumbent upon each applicant to visit the appropriate school’s website to understand the filing deadline and materials required.</p>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook "><i>Each student should submit only one WBB application. Applicants are advised to submit to the university where they want to be considered for admission to its other programs. Similarly, applying to WBB will not influence chances for admission to any of the three universities or other programs of interest.</i></p>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">Prospective freshmen applicants are encouraged to visit campus through one of our visit programs. In addition, USC offers admission programming in many domestic and international city venues. Please see our upcoming event schedule for more details,

    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">Please also take into consideration that other costs will occur each year, such as travel expenses (related to moving from one country to another), books, supplies, medical insurance and personal expenses. WBB advisors will work with families and
        students to help them define these costs.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">Scholarships</h1>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">WBB is targeted for students with an outstanding academic record. The WBB universities offer merit-based scholarships covering one-half or one-quarter of annual tuition fees. Once awarded, they can be renewed from year to year, if academic requirements
        are upheld. All applicants will be automatically considered for scholarships based on their academic merit, distinguished accomplishments and skills.</p>
    <p style="font-family:orig_nationalbook ">There is no need to file a separate scholarship application. Students should check for other country-specific scholarships, financial aid packages and loans on the websites of the three partner schools. Candidates for regionally accepted merit programs
        should inquire if the award program can be applied toward the WBB program.</p>
